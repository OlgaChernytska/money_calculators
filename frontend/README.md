# Financial Calculator
A React-based financial calculator application built with Vite, TypeScript, and Material-UI. 

## Development

Start the Development Server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Lint the Code:
```bash
npm run lint
```

Format the Code:
```bash
npm run format
```

## Testing

Run Tests:
```bash
npm run test
```


## Build

Build the App for Production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Compiles the TypeScript code and bundles the app using Vite.
Outputs optimized static files to the dist folder.
Use before deploying or testing the production build.


Preview the Production Build Locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

Serves the dist folder locally to test the production build.
Opens at http://localhost:4173 (or http://localhost:4173/repo-name if base is set).
Simulates how the app will behave when deployed.


## Deployment

Deploy to GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

Runs npm run build to generate the dist folder.
Adds a 404.html file for SPA routing (if scripted).
Pushes the dist folder to the gh-pages branch using the gh-pages package.
Deploys the app to https://username.github.io/repo-name.


Prepare for Deployment (Manual Step, if needed):
cp dist/index.html dist/404.html


Copies index.html to 404.html to handle client-side routing on GitHub Pages.
Ensures subroutes (e.g., /calculator) work correctly.



Additional Utilities

Check for Outdated Dependencies:
npm outdated


Lists dependencies that have newer versions available.


Update Dependencies:
npm install


After updating package.json, run to install new versions.
For major updates, use npm-check-updates:ncu -u && npm install




Clean Build Artifacts:
npm run clean


Removes the dist folder and other build artifacts (if scripted).
Example: rm -rf dist.


Clear npm Cache (if build/install issues occur):
npm cache clean --force



Project Structure

src/: Source code, including React components, types, and styles.
dist/: Production build output (generated by npm run build).
public/: Static assets served as-is (e.g., favicon, images).
vite.config.ts: Vite configuration for build and development settings.
package.json: Defines dependencies and scripts.

Deployment Notes

GitHub Pages:

The app is deployed to https://username.github.io/repo-name.
Ensure the homepage field in package.json is set:"homepage": "https://username.github.io/repo-name"


The base in vite.config.ts should match:base: '/repo-name/'


The gh-pages branch is used as the source in GitHub Pages settings.


Routing:

Client-side routing (e.g., React Router) requires dist/404.html to handle subroutes.
Test routing locally with npm run preview or serve dist --single.



Troubleshooting

Build Fails:

Check TypeScript errors with tsc -b.
Clear cache: npm cache clean --force.
Reinstall dependencies: rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install.


Routing Issues on GitHub Pages:

Ensure dist/404.html exists.
Verify base in vite.config.ts and homepage in package.json.


Large Bundle Size:

If Vite warns about chunks >500 kB, increase chunkSizeWarningLimit:build: { chunkSizeWarningLimit: 600 }


Or use code-splitting (e.g., React.lazy) for optimization.



Contributing
